# Reading List
Mainly on language acquisition (for AI research)

## Linguistics / Psychology

- Ambridge and Blything (2015) [A connectionist model of the retreat from verb argument structure overgeneralization](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-child-language/article/div-classtitlea-connectionist-model-of-the-retreat-from-verb-argument-structure-overgeneralizationa-hreffns01-ref-typefnadiv/0C5880E0C5D9E3EC968E6A2F34667BAB)
- Barak et al. (2014) [Learning Verb Classes in an Incremental Model](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-2005)
  - Present an incremental Bayesian model that simultaneously and incrementally learns argument structure constructions and verb classes given naturalistic language input.
- Barak et al. (2016) [Comparing Computational Cognitive Models of Generalization in a Language Acquisition Task](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D16/D16-1010.pdf)
  - Compare two recent approaches, a Bayesian model (Barak et al., 2014) )and a connectionist model (Ambridge and Blything, 2015), in their ability to replicate human judgments of appropriate generalizations.
  - Find that the Bayesian model more accurately mimics the judgments due to its richer learning mechanism that can exploit distributional properties of the input.
- Meylan et al. (2017) [The Emergence of an Abstract Grammatical Category in Childrenâ€™s EarlySpeech](http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers_new/meylan-inpress-psychsci.pdf)
